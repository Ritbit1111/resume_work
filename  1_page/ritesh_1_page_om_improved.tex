 \item Determined the best possible orientation of solar panel for \textbf{maximum power output} in different regions.
\item Performed \textbf{parametric analysis on System Advisor Model software} by varying tilt and azimuthal angle% in northern, southern and equatorial regions for summers and winters.
%  \item Concluded that optimized tilt angle was latitude angle and panel should face south in northern hemisphere and vice versa
\item Concluded that optimal tilt angle is latitude angle and optimal azimuth is 180 in north and 0 in south
%\item Observed for equatorial regions optimal azimuth angle changed seasonally and axis tracking was effective
