\item Conceptualized and fabricated  a \textbf{3D printed} device capable of detecting the presence of \textbf{Salmonella Typhi Cells} in a \SI{25}{\micro\litre} human clinical blood sample having concentration as low as \textbf{5 CFU/ml} (colony-forming unit per ml)
\item Critically investigated the number of LEDs, \textbf{photo-detectors} and their placement in the system to detect a change in the output wavelength from a solution of the human clinical blood sample and SYBR Green I Dye
\item Engineered the structure of a \textbf{scattering model} to develop a compact device, integrating an \textbf{Arduino} as micro-controller, a Graphic LCD screen to display results and a Bluetooth module to communicate with a mobile application
\item Developed an Android application to communicate with the device via Bluetooth and store the data in a CSV file
\end{itemize}
